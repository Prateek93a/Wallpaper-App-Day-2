# WallPaper App React Native #Day2 


This is my first project for #100DaysOfCode challenge. It is a wallpaper that is inspired by Varun Nath's wallpaper app.
Basically what it does is it displays you 10 wallpaper recommendations. You can tap on them and a toolbar will popup from where 
you can share the wallpaper link, save the wallpaper to the gallery, or refresh to get new recommendations. It is built on React Native
using expo-cli and utilizes Unsplash api for images. 

To use the app-
1)clone the repo
2)install all dependencies using npm install
3)launch the project using npm start

Before doing the above steps, make sure you have expo-cli installed as well as you have a valid ACCESS_KEY of Unsplash Api. To 
obtain the key, just go to https://unsplash.com/developers, make an account and request for the key by registering the app there, its very simple. Then use 
the Access_key in the Access_key variable in loadNewImgs function in Class App in App.js file.

This app is still not perfect as Sharing part is not working properly. Also animations can be made smoother and  activity loaders
can be used. Also icons can be used in the toolbar. Looking forward for contributions :)

While building the app, I realised that watching a tutorial to build something is so much easier than building the app yourself.
I made several mistakes and it was very frustrating dealing with bugs but now its done. Hope you all like it.
